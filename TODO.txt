Another suggestion to do with male virility. Right now, there is no way to make a male sterile (incapable of impregnating a female) and still have a penis, and currently you can move the testes into the body, but still have them breed. I propose changing the current system to three states instead of two.
Currently it's: Removed (but really inside the body) and normal scrotum.
What I'm proposing: Removed (actually removed), Internal (the previous version of removed), and normal scrotum.


I ask because the new Internal would be good for Lamia, Scylla, Nereid and dragonkin to have males with internal testes. (I have to remove the balls for all but the dragonkin because think about it... a snake with balls. An octopus with balls. A fish with balls.)

crychance = 100-(currentmood+fastif(depressia))
